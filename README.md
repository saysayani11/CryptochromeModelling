# HOMOLOGY MODELLING OF HUMAN CRYTPOCHROME-1

MODELLER is used for homology or comparative modeling of protein three-dimensional structures. 
The user provides an alignment of a sequence to be modeled with known related structures and 
MODELLER calculates a model.

TASK:

To model human cryptochrome-1 

REQUIREMENTS

1. Existing mouse cryptochrome model (5T5X: High resolution structure of mouse Cryptochrome 1)
2. Python scripts
3. A visualization tool (Eg: Chimera)
4. Python and MODELLER program installed in your system.

HOW DE WE MODEL?

Go over to https://github.com/saysayani11/model_hcry1_using_python/blob/main/Homology%20Modelling%20of%20%20hcry1.pdf 
which is a step-by-step guide to generate human cryptochrome-1 models from available mouse cryptochrome models.
